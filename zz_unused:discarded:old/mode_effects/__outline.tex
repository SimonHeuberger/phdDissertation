\section*{Theory}
	\begin{coi}
		\item Entropy: What is the difference? What is `more entropic` than the other, and what does that mean? What's the point Homola et al. make?
	\end{coi}


\section*{General}
	\begin{coi}
		\item It looks like this isn't workable. I can't afford a phone survey. Plus, it's doubtful whether this entropy stuff was such a great idea to begin with
		\item There is a very slight possibility that this might still be salvageable through NORC with Angela (contact made by Natalie)
		\item This turned out to go nowhere; I never heard from her again. Leave it be and find something else
	\end{coi}
