# MORALS, SELF-INTEREST, AND FRAME STRENGTH {#framing}

## Introduction {#framing-intro}

Barack Obama presented the first outline of the Affordable Care Act in the summer of 2009. The content of the reform was put online for everyone to see, but since the administration was still working on details, it refrained from actively communicating it. Published press releases simply stated that the ACA would expand coverage and lower healthcare costs for everyone. This hesitancy turned out to be a big mistake. At the end of July, support for the ACA hovered around 43 percent. Then Sarah Palin, John McCain's choice for running mate in 2008, posted the following statement on Facebook on August 7\textsuperscript{th}: "The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society'" [@palin_statement_2009]. Palin implied that federal government workers would be able to refuse treatment to any patients and thus 'decide their fate'. Over the next two weeks, support for the ACA dropped to 35 percent while opposition rose to 52 percent. Republican lawmakers jumped at the opportunity and repeated the claim of 'death panels' whenever possible. The reform never recovered from this drop. In December 2009, four months after the statement, support and opposition were virtually identical to August. While the public was still uncertain about the exact contents of the law, Palin had asserted that it would include a Big Brother type panel that decided whether people would live or die. This drowned out any efforts by the Obama administration to show the law as a cost-reducing reform. Palin's frame of the ACA, in other words, drastically influenced public opinion of the reform.

Framing is the practice of presenting an issue to affect the way people see it. Numerous experiments have shown that frames can have substantial influence in moving people's opinions. Frames accomplish this by moving specific information to the top of people's minds. Despite an abundance of experimental framing research, however, we don't know why some frames are successful at moving information to the top of people's minds and others are not. In other words, we don't know what aspects make frames strong. I provide an avenue of clarification by testing the influence of morals and self-interest in frames.

For some time, scholars have postulated the 'death' of self-interest to explain issue positioning. People eschew their material self-interest to defend and vote according to their morals instead, as they consider them more important [see for instance @frank_whats_2004 and @haidt_2012_righteous]. Others, however, cast doubt on these claims. Morals and cultural values do not outweigh economic self-interest concerns, which in turn represent a significant factor in determining issue positioning. Which is it? Have moral concerns displaced material self-interest? Does self-interest matter more than postulated by many? I intend to shed some light on these questions with an online framing survey experiment that directly juxtaposes morals and material self-interest. To my knowledge, this setup has not been studied before. In addition to the substantive analysis, both methods developed in chapters II and III are applied and their performance is analyzed.




## Theory {#framing-theory}

### Framing {#framing-theory-framing}

People usually do not have stable, consistent, and informed opinions [@converse_nature_1964; @zaller_nature_1992]. It is therefore possible to influence people's opinion through communication. One of the ways to do so is framing. Framing is the practice of presenting an issue to affect the way people see it [@aaroe_investigating_2011;@druckman_evaluating_2001;@gross_framing_2008]. We learn about healthcare reform through articles, reports, speeches, commercials and social media. This mediated communication possesses tremendous potential influence on our perception of political issues [@iyengar_framing_1996;@kam_risk_2010;@tversky_framing_1981]. Framing research has established that a variety of frames substantively influence how people view and think about issues, such as the ACA [@price_switching_1997;@andsager_how_2000;@callaghan_introduction_2005;@entman_framing_1993;@entman_projections_2004;@gamson_media_1989;@lahav_ideological_2012;@pan_framing_1993;@slothuus_political_2010;@sniderman_structure_2004;@vreese_effects_2004]. When frames influence people's opinion about an issue, we speak of a framing effect. Two different types of framing effects have evolved in the literature: Equivalency and emphasis framing effects.

Equivalency framing effects involve phrasing the same logical content in different ways, i.e. "casting the same information in either a positive or negative light" [@druckman_2004_political, p. 671]. One example is @tversky_framing_1981's death and survival experiment: Presented with a hypothetical disease outbreak in the US that is expected to kill 600 people, respondents were asked to choose between alternating programs. The first group chose between programs A and B. In program A, "200 people will be saved". In program B, "there is 1/3 probability that 600 people will be saved and 2/3 probability that no people will be saved". The second group chose between programs C and D. In program C, "400 people will die". In program D, "there is 1/3 probability that nobody will die, and 2/3 probability that 600 people will die". The factual content given to both groups is of course identical: In both groups, the first program results in the death of 400 people, and the second program has a 66 percent chance of killing all 600 people. The differences is the light cast on this information. The frames given to group 1 focus on lives saved, whereas the frames presented to group 2 center on lives lost. Rationally, both are the same. However, this difference in equalency framing matters: The majority in group 1 chose program A. The majority in group 2 chose program D. Other work focuses on policy evaluations, rather than risk preferences. For example, respondents were found to rate a proposed economic program more favorably when it is framed as resulting in 95 percent employment, instead of it's logical equivalent, 5 percent unemployment [@quattrone_1988_contrasting]. Equivalency framing effects have been likened by some to survey question wording effects [@zaller_nature_1992]. Examples here are the alternate use of "not allow" and "forbid" in reference to Communist speech in the 1970s, which can arguably be described as substantively and logically equivalent [@bartels_2003_democracy, p. 61].

Emphasis framing effects concern putting the stress on a particular aspect, viewpoint, or consideration about an issue in the attempt to get people to look at the issue in the proposed way. Describing the invasion of Iraq as freeing the population and gifting them democracy, as done by the Bush administration, for instance, emphasizes a very different viewpoint than a possible alternative narrative that focuses on the economic benefits of gaining access to oil fields and trade opportunities. Unlike equivalency frames, emphasis frames are not logically identical ways of phrasing the same issue. Instead, they highlight qualitatively different considerations of that issue [@druckman_implications_2001; @druckman_limits_2001; @kinder_1996_divided; @levin_1998_frames; @nelson_1996_issue; @sniderman_structure_2004], forcing people to think about the relative importance of the differing considerations suggested by the frame [@nelson_media_1997].

<!--
More recently, a third (sub-)strain in framing literature has emerged that aims at the separation of framing and persuasion in experimental framing research. It rejects 'classic' definitions of emphasis frames as "reducing a usually complex issue to one or two central aspects" [@nelson_media_1997, p. 568] or identifying "the essence of the issue" [@gamson_1987_changing, p. 143] in favor of "a message that provides an interpretation of an issue or policy by emphasizing which aspect of the issue is relevant for evaluating it, without the frame itself providing any new substantive information about the issue" [@leeper_2020_news, p.4; also see @price_switching_1997]. Whereas persuasion entails the provision of new information to change people's opinions, framing reorganizes existing information already present in people's minds and attempts to direct people's attention towards these particular considerations [@druckman_2003_framing]. Emphasis framing should thus be seen as emphasis of existing information only, in contrast to persuasion that aspires to change people's opinions by "the supply of arguments and evidence" [@kinder_20003_communication, p. 367]. Opinion change in framing thus occurs when people put more or less consideration on previously known aspects about an issue, whereas opinion change in persuasion results from the processing of new information.
-->

My focus lies on emphasis frames. We know that emphasis frames work because they move certain information to the top of people's minds [@zaller_nature_1992]. An abundance of experiments has shown that emphasis frames elicit significant changes in issue positioning [@chong_counterframing_2013;@chong_dynamic_2010;@druckman_2003_framing;@druckman_how_2013;@druckman_limits_2001;@druckman_source_2012;@nelson_media_1997;@slothuus_more_2008]. @brewer_values_2005, for instance, find significant effects for the frames 'School vouchers create an unfair advantage' and 'School vouchers provide help for those who need it'. @druckman_source_2012 provide similar evidence for 'The Affordable Care Act gives more people equal access to health insurance' and 'The ACA increases government costs', while @druckman_how_2013 do so for 'Oil drilling provides economic benefits' and 'Oil drilling endangers marine life'. However, despite the mass of experimental framing research, we still have little insight into what makes an emphasis frame strong. We don't know why some emphasis frames elicit effects and others don't, i.e. we don't know why some emphasis frames are successful at moving certain information to the top of people's minds and others are not. We just know that strong frames are stronger than weak frames. A major challenge for framing research thus "concerns the identification of factors that make a frame strong" [@chong_framing_2007, p. 116]. 

In the attempt to address this challenge, scholars have increasingly adopted theory-driven approaches that deduce likely strong frames and subsequently empirically evaluate their theoretical expectations. [@arceneaux_cognitive_2012, p. 280] for instance theorizes that "individuals are more likely to be persuaded by political arguments that evoke cognitive biases" and asserts that messages which highlight out-group threats resonate with respondents to a greater extent. @druckman_framing_2011 report that adding factual information to messages about carbon nanotubes does nothing to enhance their strength and actually makes the message weaker. @feinberg_2013_moral assess whether frames are stronger when they cohere with an individual's personal value system. They frame environmental issues as a matter of moral 'purity', a theme that supposedly correlates with conservative ideology, and find this approach leads to increased conservative support of environmental policies. I attempt to provide a further avenue of clarification by testing the theory that morals contribute to frame strength.





### Morals {#framing-theory-morals}

<!--
What is morality? How are morals/values related to the concept of self? How are they related to political issues? What are the main morals in human interaction?

Conservatives want strong government regulation in personal behaviors and lifestyles (abortion, gay marriage), but autonomy in economics and public goods
Liberals want strong government regulation in economics and public goods (welfare, affirmative action), but autonomy in personal behaviors and lifestyles [@janoff-bulman_2013_surveying]

Political conservatism is based in avoidance motivation
Political liberalism is based in approach motivation
-->

Two of the main ingredients of public opinion are commitment to principles (i.e. morals) and material interests that citizens see at stake [@kinder_1998_opinion]. Morals play a role in establishing one's self-concept and identity. Moral arguments can achieve a much higher emotional connection with people because they invoke people's values and feelings [@skitka_moral_2005;@skitka_moral_2011;@haidt_moral_2003;@tatalovich_moral_2011]. Emotions play an important role in how people conceptualize moral stimuli since people feel emotionally committed to their values [@ryan_reconsidering_2014; @suhay_2008_group; @tetlock_1996_revising]. Appeals to values/morals tend to be more successful than non-moral appeals "especially when the moral principles invoked resonate with the individuals targeted by the appeal" [@feinberg_2013_moral, p. 57]. Moralization literature conceptually defines moral arguments as (1) near-universal standards of truth, (2) almost objective facts about the world, and (3) independent of institutional authority [@skitka_psychology_2010]. The strength of attitudes meaningfully differs when they are held with moral conviction [@baron_protected_1997;@bennis_costs_2010;@ditto_motivated_2009;@tetlock_correspondence_2003]. It is widely argued that people rely to a disproportionate extent on moral arguments to form their opinions [@ryan_no_2014;@ryan_reconsidering_2014;@smith_typologies_2002]. Morals in the Western world focus mostly on the ethic of autonomy (i.e. harming, cheating, or oppressing other people) [@haidt_2012_righteous].  

Moral arguments are ubiquitous in political issues because they are essential to how people perceive and make sense of the world around them [@frank_whats_2004;@mooney_public_2001;@tatalovich_moral_1994]. A lot of scholarly work tries to establish a distinction between moral and non-moral issues, yet agreement on the definition of a 'moral issue' remains elusive. To some, an issue is moral when at least one side sees the issue as threatening a core value/principle and/or uses moral arguments to support their position [@mooney_public_2001; @haider-markel_1996_politics]. To others, moral issues are based on values rooted deeply within people's belief systems [@biggers_2011_when; @glick_2001_physician-assisted]. Yet another strain sees morality as intrinsic to some issues, i.e. nontechnical issues that are easy to understand or issues that concern fundamental aspects of life and death [@engeli_2012_theoretical; @studlar_2001_what; @tavits_2007_principle]. Despite these divergences, scholars appear to agree that economic issues are not to be considered moral [@abramowitz_1995_abortion; @engeli_2012_theoretical; @frank_whats_2004; @mooney_1995_legislative; @tatalovich_moral_2011]. This distinction in unison, particularly given the divergence on the definition of a 'moral issue', is puzzling.

The idea of deciding up-front whether an issue is moral, i.e. examining how people respond in situations that meet pre-set definitions of morality, follows the tradition of moral judgment. In the realm of moral judgment, researchers decide, objectively along a set of criteria, whether an issue is moral. This stands in contrast to moral conviction. In moral conviction theory, morality lies in the eye of the beholder, i.e. people decide whether they consider an issue to be moral. Moral conviction "classifies stimuli as moral or non-moral as a function of individuals' perceptions of situations rather than according to characteristics of the situation" [@bauman_2009_mind, p. 342]. Rather than presupposing the morality of an issue externally, it is argued that people recognize a moral sentiment when they experience one, as it touches their perceived connection of what is right and wrong [@bandura_1986_social; @cervone_2004_architecture; @goodwin_2008_psychology; @skitka_2008_morality]. This recognition and perception, however, varies considerably depending on the person experiencing the potentially moral situation. Defining an issue or situation as moral then becomes a subjective endeavor for each individual person and their psychological reality [@haidt_2001_emotional; @haidt_2003_emotional; @morgan_2010_moral; @skitka_2008_moral]. What I consider to be moral might not be moral to you, and vice versa. The literature shows that moral conviction represents an important force that guides citizen behavior and development of public opinion [@converse_nature_1964;@skitka_moral_2005;@skitka_moral_2011;@smith_typologies_2002;@tatalovich_moral_2011;@zaller_nature_1992]. This has consequences for survey design. Rather than deciding pre-survey which issues are moral (moral judgment), researchers "directly assess the extent that a given issue engages moral conviction and then use those responses to classify whether situations are or are not moral for a specific individual" [@bauman_2009_mind, p. 343]. Following this approach, @ryan_reconsidering_2014 finds evidence that some people perceive distinctly economic issues such as labor relations laws or social security reform in moral ways. Studies on abortion also show that, despite the media's contrary depiction, not everyone conceives of it as a moral issue [@mullen_2006_exploring; @skitka_2002_means; @skitka_moral_2005].

In normative terms, we differentiate between prescriptive and proscriptive morality, which are based on approach-avoidance differences in self-regulation [@carnes_2012_harm]. Prescriptive morality is sensitive to positive outcomes and focused on what we should do. Proscriptive morality is sensitive to negative outcomes and focused on what we should not do [@janoff-bulman_2009_proscriptive]. Based on this categorization, Haidt and his colleagues developed Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), which encompasses the cognitive foundations of moral matrices, which has become widely adopted in moralization literature [@graham_2009_liberals; @haidt_2001_emotional; @haidt_2003_emotional; @haidt_2012_righteous; @haidt_moral_2003; @haidt_2004_intuitive; @haidt_2007_moral; @haidt_2007_synthesis; @haidt_2007_when; @haidt_2008_morality; @haidt_2010_morality]. These foundations are shown in Table \ref{framing-foundations}.

Moral intuitions are a powerful psychological mechanism that underlies issue positions [@koleva_2012_tracing]. MFT has been described as the best candidate to represent the universal cognitive intuitions upon which cultures construct moral matrices [@hofmann_2014_morality; @schein_2017_theory; @clifford_2015_moral]. Care/Harm developed as the response to the adaptive challenge of protecting and caring for children. It makes us sensitive to signs of suffering and activates us to care for those who are being harmed. Fairness/Cheating developed as the response to acts of cooperation or selfishness that people show towards us. It makes us trust fair actors and punish cheaters. Loyalty/Betrayal developed to meet the adaptive challenge of forming and maintaining cohesive coalitions. It makes us reward loyalty and ostracize those who betray us. Authority/Subversion developed as the response to forging beneficial relationships within social hierarchies. It makes us sensitive to signs that people do not behave in accordance with their social position. Sanctity/Degradation developed as a response to the challenge of living in world full of pathogens and parasites. It binds us into moral communities by shared notions of sacredness. Liberty/Oppression developed as a response to the challenge of living in small groups whose members can dominate and constrain us. It makes us value freedom and reject repression.

Because of the deep connection between morals and emotions, people have a tendency to internalize and defend their values. This "makes it very difficult for people to consider the possibility that there might really be more than one form of moral truth, or more than one valid framework for judging people or running a society" [@haidt_2012_righteous, p. 111]. Haidt and his colleagues applied MFT to polarization in the US and found pronounced differences, most notably that liberals utilize a three-foundation morality, whereas conservatives use all six foundations. Moreover, both sides focus on different aspects in the three foundations they share: Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating, and Liberty/Oppression. Everyone cares about these foundations, but liberals and conservatives do so in different ways. Conservatives emphasize society's protection and security and aim to prevent losses and generally negative outcomes. They resist change, emphasize social order, see liberty as the right to be left alone (e.g. with regards to the environment or workers' rights), and define fairness in terms of proportionality (i.e. those who work hardest should be paid the most). Liberals on the other hand emphasize the provision of welfare for others and aim to advance gains and generally positive outcomes. They embrace change, emphasize social justice, see liberty as the right of vulnerable populations (minorities, children, animals) to be defended by the government, and define fairness as equal provision for all. Both seek normatively 'good' outcomes for society, but with different orientations [@janoff-bulman_2009_provide; @janoff-bulman_2009_proscriptive; @janoff-bulman_2013_surveying].

Haidt and his colleagues focused on the liberal/conservative divide. As a result, their moral foundations have found broad application in approaches centered on party ID [@koleva_2012_tracing; @feinberg_2013_moral; @clifford_2013_words]. I argue, however, that they can also be used outside of partisan emphasis, as long as the differences between liberals and conservatives in their moral bases are considered. My focus instead lies on the juxtaposition of morality and self-interest.




### Self-Interest {#framing-theory-self_interest}

<!--
[@kahneman_fairness_1986; @weatherford_economic_1983]

Unenlightened self-interest [@bartels_2005_homer]: 
A majority of Americans supported the 2001 and 2003 Bush administration tax cuts, even though they were designed to disproportionately benefit the rich. Economic self-interest can't explain this, since the majority of Americans suffered economically from the cuts. As Bartels shows, neither can people's attitudes towards the tax burden born by the rich. 
-->

Two of the main ingredients of public opinion are commitment to principles (i.e. morals) and material interests that citizens see at stake [@kinder_1998_opinion]. Section \ref{framing-theory-morals} covers morals. This section addresses material interests. 

Self-interest theory is part of rational choice theory and sees human behavior as inherently selfish and egocentric. Human beings are said to first and foremost look out for themselves in life and act on the grounds of utility maximization [@arrow_1967_values; @downs_economic_1957; @ferejohn_paradox_1974; @fiorina_congress:_1977; @olson_logic_1965; @coleman_1986_individual; @riker_theory_1968]. This claim became so fundamental in modern economics that it led to the postulation of human beings as \textit{homines economici} [@coleman_1986_individual]; creatures who act strictly rationally with the intent to maximize their personal gains and profits. It follows the idea that the individual and society both benefit most when each individual pursues his or her own interest. This assumption has been highly influential in many theories of human behavior, has pervaded models of neoclassical economics, political science, sociology, as well as philosophy, and is not restricted to particular issues. It presents self-interest as the cardinal human motive: "I assume that most people most of the time act in their own self-interest" [@fiorina_congress:_1977, p. 38]. Americans are said to usually react and act to issues based on self-interest [@campbell_american_1960].

Over the past decades, however, an abundance of criticism has emerged that asserts the theoretical inadequacy of the postulated self-interest model as the sole predictor of human behavior. @miller_power_1996 call "homo economicus (...) a social construction, not a biological entity" (p. 45). Human behavior is argued to be too complex and much more than self-interest is claimed to come into play when people think about what they want in life [@batson_altruism_1991; @friedland_beyond_1989; @kohn_brighter_1990; @lerner_belief_1980; @mansbridge_preface_1990; @mansbridge_1990_relation; @schwartz_battle_1986; @sen_rational_1977; @tyler_1990_people]. The study of social movements, for instance, provides clear evidence that motivations other than self-interest also majorly account for human behavior [@mansbridge_rise_1990]. The overall most important reasons for humans' choices are affective and normative [@etzioni_moral_1988] and we need to shift our focus away from obsession with self-interest and towards moral values [@hirschman_against_1985]. The dominant theories of motivation are fundamentally based on personal gains and miss the influence that values and ideologies have on people's attitudes towards policies [@sears_self-interest_1990]. People are more interested in the fairness of procedures and policies than the material outcomes of these processes [@tyler_justice_1990]. It is possible and plausible that self-interest plays a role in attitude formation, but it is far from self-evident, and even then it does not play the only role [@chong_when_2001; @citrin_1990_self-interest; @miller_norm_1999; @sears_self-interest_1990].

Empirical research from the 1970s and 1980s tests rational choice theory claims about self-interest [@batson_altruism_1991; @etzioni_moral_1988; @feldman_economic_1982; @feldman_economic_1984; @friedland_beyond_1989; @hirschman_against_1985; @kohn_brighter_1990; @lau_cognitive_1981; @lerner_belief_1980; @mansbridge_preface_1990; @miller_power_1996; @schwartz_battle_1986; @sears_tax_1985; @weatherford_economic_1983]. These studies utilize both objective and subjective measures of self-interest. Objective variables include for instance household income, whereas subjective parameters focus on perceived personal status, such as 'How would you rate the amount of taxes you pay?' [@bobo_whites_1983]. Scholars focus on economics, particularly taxation and pocketbook voting, as these most closely reflect the self-interest notion of material gains.^[Pocketbook voting refers to voters making decisions based on the state of their personal finances.] 

Results for objective measures of self-interest are mixed. On the one hand, @hawthorne_individual_1987 find that income level and tax bracket significantly predicts support for the tax cuts in the 1978 federal Tax Revenue Act. @lau_proposition_1983 identify a similar relationship for high taxpayers in their Massachusetts income tax study. @coughlin_economic_1990 discover that higher income citizens oppose redistribution slightly more than lower income ones. @sears_self-interest_1980 and @sears_inducing_1983 find evidence for pocketbook voting in their studies on government-guaranteed full employment. On the other hand, the unemployed do not favor policies to increase employment more than those with jobs [@schlozman_1979_injury], people with health concerns do not show stronger support for government health insurance than others [@sears_self-interest_1980], working women do not differ from homemakers in their attitudes towards benefits for women in the workplace [@sears_1990_origins], and pocketbook voting does not determine congressional votes [@kiewet_macroeconomics_1983]. Yet again, the unemployed are said to actually do line up behind policies that help the unemployed, uninsured Americans favor a government role in health insurance, and African-Americans are the biggest supporters of race-based affirmative action [@weeden_2014_hidden].

Subjective measures result in somewhat clearer findings. @courant_why_1980 discover modest but consistent effects for the perceived property tax burden in Michigan. @lau_fact_1990 find a significant relationship between perceived financial situation and anti-incumbent voting. The analysis by @sears_inducing_1983 reveals that perceived personal federal tax burden predicts support for the tax cuts specified in the 1979 Kemp-Roth bill. @bartels_2005_homer identifies a high subjective tax burden as the source of support for the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts. @sears_tax_1985 similarly find that citizens with a high subjective tax burden act out of self-interest in the so-called California Tax Revolt at the end of the 1970s. Citizens with perceived declining finances, however, do not.

In theoretical terms, then, critics of self-interest theory do not negate the importance of self-interest to explain human behavior, but instead lament the absence of sources of behavioral motivation other than self-interest among rational choice proponents. In empirical terms, material self-interest appears as a combination of objective and subjective measures, with results for the latter somewhat more unequivocal. @sears_role_1991 indeed suggest objective (amount of income, state of personal finances) and subjective (perception of the amount of taxes paid) parameters as the most suitable statistical measurements to accurately capture any evidence for material self-interest-motivated human behavior.





## Design {#framing-design}

Each of the previous areas has been studied, but they have not been applied together. An abundance of framing research exists and we know that emphasis frames work because they move information to the top of people's minds, but we still don't know why some emphasis frames succeed while others fail. We know that morals play a large role in people's issue positioning and that self-interest can explain some human behavior, but we don't know how much self-interest and morals matter in direct comparison when people choose issue positions. I conduct a framing experiment that explores what we don't know. I investigate how morals and self-interest contribute to persuasive strength in emphasis frames.

Juxtaposing morals and self-interest follows the recognition that people don't just want to satisfy their interests, but neither do they set aside their self-regarding preferences in favor of some non-self-regarding ones [@stoker_1992_interest]. Both concepts are in constant movement, depending on the situation. People deal with the 'central problem of ethics': "how the lives, interests, and welfare of others make claims on us, and how these claims, of various forms, are to be reconciled with the aim of living our own lives" [@nagel_1970_possibility, p. 142]. Support for issues, for instance the welfare state, is based on "generalized and reciprocal self-interest" [@baldwin_1990_politics, p. 299], i.e. it depends on both value-based attitudes and immediate self-interest. Policy attitudes can be shaped by perceived self-interest or alterations in empathy towards others [@hacker_insecure_2013; @rehm_2012_insecure]. It is often difficult to tell which is which: @frank_whats_2004 claims Republicans have duped rural and working-class Americans into voting against their economic self-interest by supporting Republican tax cuts that negatively affect them financially. @bartels_2005_homer argues that they instead vote in unenlightened self-interest because they perceive their personal tax burden to be too high and believe tax cuts can lower them. @haidt_2012_righteous, finally, states that they vote for their moral interest, as they don't want the country to devote itself primarily to the pursuit of social justice. Which is accurate? Without direct juxtaposition of morals and self-interest, we don't know.

Previous studies and experiments on moral framing that utilize MFT focus on partisan division [@clifford_2013_words; @feinberg_2013_moral; @koleva_2012_tracing; @slothuus_political_2010; @wolsko_2016_white]. While party ID of course matters for moral concerns, partisanship is not central to my analysis. I design frames that resonate with both parties, building on the central aspects of MFT that account for moral foundations on both sides, but I focus on the moral vs. material self-interest juxtaposition. I combine emphasis framing with moral conviction theory, aspects of Moral Foundation Theory, and the literature on material self-interest.

Framing on morals/values so far:
@slothuus_political_2010: how framing political messages in terms of values consistent with partisan motivations shapes acceptance of these messages
@wolsko_2016_white: conservatives who receive a message framed on the moral foundations that their in-group strongly endorses (loyalty, authority, sanctity) are likely to believe more in climate change 
@feinberg_2013_moral: reframing environmental messages in line with partisan moral values decreases polarization gap between liberals and conservatives

Applying Moral Foundation Theory, both frames in @brewer_values_2005 could be categorized as containing moral arguments, even though the authors do not explicitly do so. 'School vouchers create an unfair advantage' can be argued to contain the negative moral foundation of \textit{Cheating}, while 'School vouchers provide help for those who need it' contains the positive moral foundations of \textit{Care} and \textit{Fairness}. 'The ACA gives more people equal access to health insurance' [@druckman_source_2012] also could be said to contain the positive moral foundations of \textit{Care} and \textit{Fairness}, while 'Oil drilling endangers marine life' [@druckman_how_2013] contains the negative moral foundation of \textit{Harm}. 
In the case of @druckman_source_2012, 'The Affordable Care Act gives more people equal access to health insurance' contains a positive, i.e. support-inducing, moral argument, while 'The ACA increases government costs' contains a negative, i.e. opposition-inducing, non-moral argument. They act in opposite directions. A comparison of these frames alone does not yield sufficient results as we would not be able to identify the exact cause of the framing effect. Is 'The Affordable Care Act gives more people equal access to health insurance' strong because it supports the issue or because it contains a moral argument? Similarly, is 'The ACA increases government costs' strong because it opposes the issue or because it contains a non-moral argument? This set-up cannot answer these questions. 

\noindent "Self-interest is commonly defined as a short to medium-term impact on the material well-being of an individual's own personal life (or that of his or her immediate family)" [based on @sears_role_1991, p. 16].

\noindent "Morals concern what people should or should not do" -- 'Moral' description from Ryan or Skitka?. An action of yours is moral if it treats others the way you would like others to treat you (Dal Bo and Dal Bo 2014)

Issues are selected from previous research and based on suitability to assess objective and perceived self-interest. In order to assess perceived self-interest, all issues need to apply to all respondents in their daily lives. This excludes for instance abortion and same-sex marriage, both of which are not necessarily present in each respondent's life. I choose taxes and healthcare. Everyone pays taxes and can state how they feel about their tax burden. Respondents' self-identified income indicates which tax bracket they fall into and gives insights into their objective self-interest when presented with a fictitious tax policy (see the frames below). We can assess subjective self-interest by asking "Do you feel you are asked to pay more than you should in federal income taxes, about the right amount, or less than you should?" (question wording from the ANES). Similarly, everyone is affected by healthcare costs in their lives. Respondents' self-identified healthcare expenditures provides an objective measurement of their self-interest, while the question "Do you feel you are asked to pay more than you should for health insurance, about the right amount, or less than you should?" reveals their subjective healthcare cost burden.

Following moral conviction theory, each respective respondent decides for themselves whether they consider each issue moral by answering moral conviction measures such as "To what extent is your opinion on [issue] a reflection of your core moral beliefs and convictions?" [based on @ryan_no_2014; @skitka_moral_2005; @skitka_psychology_2010]. Note that respondents 'rate' each issue in terms of morality but without actually stating their position on the issue. This is to avoid anchoring.

Each respondent is presented with one of five randomly assigned frames: An issue-supporting moral frame, an issue-opposing moral frame, an issue-supporting self-interest frame, an issue-opposing self-interest frame, or the control frame. The design consists of issue-supporting and issue-opposing frames in order to control for both signs in determining frame strength. The self-interest frames aim to activate each respondent's material self-interest. The moral frames are designed following moral judgment on the basis of Moral Foundations Theory. For simplicity and to avoid cluttering, I only use the foundation of Fairness/Cheating since it represents the core foundation for both liberals and conservatives [@graham_2009_liberals]. I design frames to correspond with the partisan messages identified by Haidt and assign them according to respondents' self-identification on party ID. This means a self-identified Democrat receives a fairness/cheating frame built on aspects of fairness/cheating that most apply to liberals. Conversely, a self-identified Republican receives a fairness/cheating frame designed to reflect fairness/cheating aspects most dear to conservatives. Independent respondents randomly receive the liberal or the conservative version. Support/Opposition for/to the frame's content is assessed on a Likert scale.







### Expectations {#framing-design-expectations}

<!--
-- We can test which issues are considered more moral than others
-->

Moral conviction literature asserts that people with moralized attitudes hold those attitudes strongly. This suggests that it is difficult to move these people's attitudes, no matter what frame they are presented with. This in turn suggests that we can only move the attitudes of people who don't hold highly moralized attitudes, since there is room for movement here. For the respondents with highly moralized attitudes on the issue, their support/opposition for/to the issue should be statistically the same across all frames, since their attitudes are set and can't easily be moved. For the respondents without highly moralized attitudes on the issue, the frames should move responses towards support or opposition, depending on the direction of the frame. For these people, we can explore whether the moral or the self-interest frames cause bigger shifts. Moral attitudes are said to be more important than non-moral ones since a threat to a person's morals directly threatens that person's sense of identity and self. Non-moral arguments, on the other hand, are less related to a person's identity and thus deemed less important [@haugtvedt_1994_message; @johnson_1989_effects]. This would suggest that moral frames exert a stronger influence on respondents' issue positioning than self-interest frames. I thus pose the following hypotheses:

\vspace{0.3cm}
\begin{adjustwidth*}{+1cm}{+1cm}
\noindent \textbf{H1.} Respondents with highly moralized attitudes are not moved by any frames.\\
\textbf{H2.} Respondents without highly moralized attitudes are moved further by moral frames than self-interest frames.
\end{adjustwidth*}





## Data {#framing-data}

The designed frames are pre-tested for their moral and self-interest content on MTurk. The confirmed frames are subsequently applied in a survey experiment fielded online with Lucid.


### Pre-Tests {#framing-data-pre_test}

Survey questions are best designed if researchers have a firm grasp of the underlying realities that participants have to report [@carpini_1993_measuring;@stanley_2016_using;@conover_1991_nature]. Following this line of argument, pre-testing frames with participants who are not part of the main survey experiment is crucial in frame analysis. These participants are exposed to the designed frames and asked whether they reflect the core ideas behind moral and material self-interest. This pre-test structure builds on work by @slothuus_political_2010 and @chong_framing_2007, following the mass communication and persuasion literature [@okeefe_2002_persuasion]. The pre-test is carried out on Amazon's online platform MTurk. MTurk is a service where researchers can host tasks to be completed by anonymous participants. Participants receive financial compensation for their work and Amazon collects a commission. MTurk samples have been shown to be internally valid in survey experiments [@berinsky_evaluating_2012]. The use of MTurk in political science experiments has increased dramatically over the past decade and is now common practice [@hauser_attentive_2016]. This pre-test represents a thorough, robust safety net to ensure that the designed frames connect with participants, which in turn ensures meaningful survey results.



### Survey Experiment {#framing-data-survey}

The survey experiment builds on the insights from the pre-test. It is fielded online for a random sample of U.S. adults with Lucid. Lucid has been shown to be equally reliable and performs well on a national scale in survey experiments [@coppock_2019_validating]. The survey collects demographic information on standard political science variables and applies all successfully pre-tested frames on all chosen issues. Both methods from the previous chapters are applied. Respondents are blocked on ordinal variables with the method from chapter I. The results are evaluated substantively to reveal the effect of morals and material self-interest in respondents' issue positions. The ordinal variable imputation method from chapter II is also applied to artificially inserted missing data. This allows us to assess the performance of ordinal variable imputation method by comparing the imputation results with the true values of the completely observed data.
