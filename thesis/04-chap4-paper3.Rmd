# MORAL ARGUMENTS AS A SOURCE OF FRAME STRENGTH {#framing}


## Introduction {#framing-intro}

Barack Obama presented the first outline of the Affordable Care Act in the summer of 2009. The content of the reform was put online for everyone to see, but since the administration was still working on details, it refrained from actively communicating it. Published press releases simply stated that the ACA would expand coverage and lower health care costs for everyone. This hesitancy turned out to be a big mistake. At the end of July, support for the ACA hovered around 43 percent. Then Sarah Palin, John McCain's choice for running mate in 2008, posted the following statement on Facebook on August 7\textsuperscript{th}: "The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society'" [@palin_statement_2009]. Palin implied that federal government workers would be able to refuse treatment to any patients and thus 'decide their fate'. Over the next two weeks, support for the ACA dropped to 35 percent while opposition rose to 52 percent. Republican lawmakers jumped at the opportunity and repeated the claim of 'death panels' whenever possible. The reform never recovered from this drop. In December 2009, four months after the statement, support and opposition were virtually identical to August. While the public was still uncertain about the exact contents of the law, Palin had asserted that it would include a Big Brother type panel that decided whether people would live or die. This drowned out any efforts by the Obama administration to show the law as a cost-reducing reform. Palin's frame of the ACA, in other words, drastically influenced public opinion of the reform.

Framing is the practice of presenting an issue to affect the way people see it [@aaroe_investigating_2011;@druckman_evaluating_2001;@gross_framing_2008]. We learn about healthcare reform through articles, reports, speeches, commercials and social media. This mediated communication possesses tremendous potential influence on our perception of political issues [@iyengar_framing_1996;@kam_risk_2010;@tversky_framing_1981]. Framing research has established that a variety of frames substantively influence how people view and think about issues, such as the ACA [@price_switching_1997;@andsager_how_2000;@callaghan_introduction_2005;@entman_framing_1993;@entman_projections_2004;@gamson_media_1989;@lahav_ideological_2012;@pan_framing_1993;@slothuus_political_2010;@sniderman_structure_2004;@vreese_effects_2004]. But we do not know why these frames elicit these effects. A major challenge for framing research thus "concerns the identification of factors that make a frame strong'' [@chong_framing_2007, p. 116].

I conduct a series of tests to examine whether moral arguments form a part of what makes a frame strong. These tests include two online polls and an online survey experiment. Both methods developed in chapters II and III are applied in the survey experiment and their performance is analyzed.




## Theory {#framing-theory}

### Framing {#framing-theory-framing}

Despite the mass of experimental framing research, we still have little insight into what makes a frame strong. The larger persuasion literature "is not as illuminating as one might suppose... It is not yet known what it is about the 'strong arguments'... that makes them persuasive" [@okeefe_2002_persuasion]. One research direction is that frames are stronger overall when they cohere with an individual's personal value system. @feinberg_2012_moral frame environmental issues as a matter of 'purity', a theme that supposedly correlates with conservative ideology, and find this approach leads to increased conservative support of environmental policies. [@arceneaux_cognitive_2012, p. 280] on the other hand finds that "individuals are more likely to be persuaded by political arguments that evoke cognitive biases". Particularly, he asserts that messages which highlight out-group threats resonate to a greater extent than other, more coherent, arguments. In a study investigating the use of scientific data, @druckman_framing_2011 report that adding factual information to messages about carbon nanotubes does nothing to enhance their strength. Providing more scientific evidence seems to have the opposite effect, making the messages weaker. Overall, "it seems as if frame strength increases with frames that highlight specific emotions, invoke threat against one's own group interests, contain some incivility, include multiple, frequently appearing, arguments, and/or have been used in the past" [@druckman_political_2018, p. 22]. I attempt to provide an avenue of clarification by testing whether moral arguments are part of what makes frames strong.

### Moralization {#framing-theory-moralization}

Moralization literature conceptually defines moral arguments as (1) near-universal standards of truth, (2) almost objective facts about the world, and (3) independent of institutional authority [@skitka_psychology_2010]. Moral arguments are said to engage a distinctive mode of processing that invokes a whole range of emotions and to be distinct from other forms of arguments [@ryan_reconsidering_2014]. Scholars find that moral arguments are ubiquitous in political issues because they are essential to how people perceive and make sense of the world around them [@frank_whats_2005;@mooney_public_2001;@tatalovich_moral_1994]. @ryan_reconsidering_2014 finds evidence that some people perceive distinctly economic issues such as labor relations laws or social security reform in moral ways. Other studies similarly assert that the strength of attitudes meaningfully differs when they are held with moral conviction [@baron_protected_1997;@bennis_costs_2010;@ditto_motivated_2009;@tetlock_correspondence_2003]. It is also asserted that moral conviction represents an important force that guides citizen behavior and development of public opinion [@converse_nature_1964;@skitka_moral_2005;@skitka_moral_2011;@smith_typologies_2002;@tatalovich_moral_2011;@zaller_nature_1992]. It is widely argued that people rely to a disproportionate extent on moral arguments to form their opinions and apply this moralization to political issues [@ryan_no_2014;@ryan_reconsidering_2014;@smith_typologies_2002]. Moral arguments can achieve a much higher emotional connection with people because they invoke people's values and feelings [@skitka_moral_2005;@skitka_moral_2011;@haidt_moral_2003;@tatalovich_moral_2011]. These conceptual definitions are all encompassed in Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), developed by @haidt_2012_righteous and presented in Table \ref{framing-foundations} below.

These aspects of moralization theory have not been applied to frame strength in experimental research. An abundance of framing research has shown that frames elicit significant changes in issue positioning [@chong_counterframing_2013;@chong_dynamic_2010;@druckman_how_2013;@druckman_limits_2001;@druckman_source_2012;@nelson_media_1997;@slothuus_more_2008]. @brewer_values_2005, for instance, find significant effects for the frames 'School vouchers create an unfair advantage' and 'School vouchers provide help for those who need it'. @druckman_source_2012 provide similar evidence for 'The Affordable Care Act gives more people equal access to health insurance' and 'The ACA increases government costs', while @druckman_how_2013 do so for 'Oil drilling provides economic benefits' and 'Oil drilling endangers marine life'. While we know these frames elicit changes, we do not know why they do so. We do not know why these frames 'work'. I propose a way to understand why some of these frames work, which is based on moralization theory: The presence of moral arguments. 

Applying Moral Foundation Theory, both frames in @brewer_values_2005 could be categorized as containing moral arguments, even though the authors do not explicitly do so. 'School vouchers create an unfair advantage' can be argued to contain the negative moral foundation of \textit{Cheating}, while 'School vouchers provide help for those who need it' contains the positive moral foundations of \textit{Care} and \textit{Fairness}. 'The ACA gives more people equal access to health insurance' [@druckman_source_2012] also could be said to contain the positive moral foundations of \textit{Care} and \textit{Fairness}, while 'Oil drilling endangers marine life' [@druckman_how_2013] contains the negative moral foundation of \textit{Harm}. 

It is important to note that 'The ACA increases government costs' [@druckman_source_2012] and 'Oil drilling provides economic benefits' [@druckman_how_2013] do not directly appeal to morality, yet research has shown them to be strong. Of course, some people might see increasing costs immediately as bad and thus morally detrimental for the future of the country, but these frames do not make such an appeal directly, on the surface. This distinguishes them from moral frames.

This might lead one to assert that moral arguments do not form a part of frame strength -- after all, if a frame does not contain a direct moral argument but is proven to be strong nonetheless, surely then frame strength does not depend on the presence of moral arguments. This hypothetical argument is flawed, however. For one, the search for the source of frame strength is not the search for a universal 'holy grail' argument whose presence is a precondition for frame strength. There probably are many aspects that can make a frame strong, with moral arguments potentially being one of them, not the only one. Second, the studies with these two amoral and two moral arguments do not distinguish between the directions in which the moral and amoral frames act. 

In the case of @druckman_source_2012, 'The Affordable Care Act gives more people equal access to health insurance' contains a positive, i.e. support-inducing, moral argument, while 'The ACA increases government costs' contains a negative, i.e. opposition-inducing, amoral argument. They act in opposite directions. A comparison of these frames alone does not yield sufficient results as we would not be able to identify the exact cause of the framing effect. Is 'The Affordable Care Act gives more people equal access to health insurance' strong because it supports the issue or because it contains a moral argument? Similarly, is 'The ACA increases government costs' strong because it opposes the issue or because it contains a amoral argument? This set-up cannot answer these questions. 

To establish whether moral arguments are part of what makes a frame strong, we need a design that assesses the strength of frames with moral and amoral arguments whilst accounting for both signs, opposing and supporting, in both sets of frames. I provide such a design.

Overall, experimental framing research has shown that many frames have significant framing effects. It is still unclear, however, what makes these, or indeed any, frame strong [@druckman_political_2018]. Moralization theory claims that moral arguments possess enormous power shape human behavior and influence public opinion [@haidt_moral_2003]. I combine these two sets of literature and analyze whether moral arguments form a part of what makes frames strong. I use a variety of data sources to investigate the following hypothesis:

\textbf{H.} Moral arguments form a part of what makes political frames strong.

## Data {#framing-data}

First, I field an online poll that asks participant to assess how moral frames in published research are. Second, I design and test moral and amoral complementary frames to the ones used in previous research in a second online poll. Finally, I conduct the main online survey experiment.

Testing and pre-testing frames is crucial in frame analysis. Frames need to be tested with participants who are not part of the main survey. These participants are exposed to the designed frames and asked whether they reflect the core ideas behind moral and pragmatic arguments. This pre-test structure builds on work by @slothuus_political_2010 and @chong_framing_2007, following the mass communication and persuasion literature [@okeefe_2002_persuasion]. The pre-test is carried out  on Amazon's online platform MTurk. Together with the post-test included in the survey, these tests represent a thorough, robust, spread-out safety net to ensure that the designed frames connect with participants, which in turn ensures meaningful survey results.


### Online Poll #1: The Moral Content of Frames Used in Previous Studies {#framing-data-pollprevious}

I test frames from previous in a simple online poll, which asks participants to rate how moral each argument in each frame is on a scale of 1 (Not moral at all) to 5 (Very moral). This provides me with a list of how moral or amoral the strong frames from previous research. The poll is fielded on MTurk. Survey questions are best designed if researchers have a firm grasp of the underlying realities that participants have to report [@carpini_1993_measuring;@stanley_2016_using;@conover_1991_nature].


Because the design in previous experimental framing studies does not account for direction (see section \ref{framing-theory-moralization}), this list is a mixture of positive moral frames, negative moral frames, positive amoral frames, and negative amoral frames. Crucially, there will not be 'perfect pairings' that account for direction of support and moral content. To fill these missing 'slots', I design moral and amoral frames that complement the existing moral and amoral frames. Depending on what the missing 'slot' is, these frames are either positive moral, negative moral, positive amoral, or negative amoral. In order to do so, however, I first conduct another online poll, insights of which inform the design of said frames.


### Online Poll #2: The Moral Content of Designed Complementary Frames {#framing-data-polldesigned}

I use the insights from the second online poll to design several frames for each of the missing 'slots' in previous experiments.  I develop several frames for each missing 'slot'. Once I have designed these frames, I will conduct another simple online poll which asks participants to rate how moral each argument in each designed frame is on a scale of 1 (Not moral at all) to 5 (Very moral). Similar to the online poll in section \ref{framing-data-pollprevious}, this assesses the moral content of the frames I designed. This is to make sure that the designed frames connect with people in terms of moral content in the intended way. Like the previous poll, this poll is also fielded on MTurk.


### Survey Experiment {#framing-data-survey}

Finally, I design a questionnaire for a survey experiment that combines all the insights from the previous tests and thoroughly examines whether moral arguments form a part of what makes a frame strong. The experiment is fielded online for a random sample of U.S. adults on Lucid. It features frames with moral and amoral arguments that have been shown to elicit effects (tested for moral content in the first online poll) and frames with moral and amoral arguments that fill missing 'slots' (designed based on insights from the second online poll). The survey also collects demographic information and includes post-treatment evaluations in terms of rating the arguments by their moral content. The political issues the frames apply are determined by the issues used in previous framing experiments. Both methodological contributions from chapters II and III are applied.

Participants are separately sequentially blocked into five treatment groups. The blocking algorithm is performed once on the original ANES edcuation categories for one half of participants and once on the ordered probit education categories for the other half. We then conduct an ordered probit regression on an ordinal response variable on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from "Strongly oppose" to "Strongly support". We then compare the differences between the ordered probit and the original results whilst knowing which one is closer to the truth based on the simulation results from section \ref{ordblock-data}. This thus tests the performance of the ordered probit method (chapter II).

Participants are not given the option to select "Don't Know" or "Refuse", resulting in completely observed data. We then introduce random missing data, and show how the ordinal affinity score method (chapter III) performs on ordinal variables compared with other methods. We can assess the performance of the ordinal affinity score method because we know the true values of the completely observed data.
