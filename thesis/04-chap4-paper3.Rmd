# MORAL ARGUMENTS AS A SOURCE OF FRAME STRENGTH {#framing}




Moral conviction literature tells us that people with moralized attitudes hold those attitudes strongly. This indicates that these people's attitudes can't be easily be moved, no matter what frame they are presented with. As a result, we can only move the attitudes of people who don't hold highly moralized attitudes, since there is room for movement here.

(ONE) Give descriptions of what 'moral' and 'self-interest' is.

Ad hoc examples: "Moral concerns what people should or should not do", "Self-interest concerns actions and attitudes that only suit yourself".
'Moral' description comes from Ryan, who extended Skitka's moral conviction measure. I extend this further by adding a 'self-interest' description, which I still need to find. 

(TWO) Ask about respondents' moral conviction towards an issue.

Moral conviction measure from Skitka: "To what extent is your position on [issue] a reflection of your core moral beliefs and convictions" and "... connected to your fundamental beliefs about right and wrong?".
I ask how 'moral' they consider their position on the issue, but without actually asking them what their position is. This is to avoid anchoring.

(THREE) Measure moral conviction towards the issue (1-5 Likert; "Not at all", "Slightly", "Moderately", "Much", "Very much").

(FOUR) Randomly assign one of the five frames: Opposing moral frame, opposing self-interest frame, control frame, supporting moral frame, supporting self-interest frame. 

(FIVE) Measure support/opposition for/to the issue (1-5 Likert; "Strongly oppose" ... "Strongly approve").

Expectations: 

For the respondents with highly moralized attitudes on the issue, their support/opposition for/to the issue should be statistically the same across all frames, since their attitudes are set and can't easily be moved. For the respondents without highly moralized attitudes on the issue, the frames should move responses towards support or opposition, depending on the direction of the frame. For these people, we can see whether the moral or the self-interest frames cause bigger shifts.

To be gained from this experiment:

-- We can test which issues are considered more moral than others

-- We can test whether people with highly moralized attitudes really stick to their pre-formed attitudes, no matter what they're exposed to

-- We can test whether people with low moralized attitudes are more influenced by moral or self-interest frames



## Introduction {#framing-intro}

Barack Obama presented the first outline of the Affordable Care Act in the summer of 2009. The content of the reform was put online for everyone to see, but since the administration was still working on details, it refrained from actively communicating it. Published press releases simply stated that the ACA would expand coverage and lower health care costs for everyone. This hesitancy turned out to be a big mistake. At the end of July, support for the ACA hovered around 43 percent. Then Sarah Palin, John McCain's choice for running mate in 2008, posted the following statement on Facebook on August 7\textsuperscript{th}: "The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society'" [@palin_statement_2009]. Palin implied that federal government workers would be able to refuse treatment to any patients and thus 'decide their fate'. Over the next two weeks, support for the ACA dropped to 35 percent while opposition rose to 52 percent. Republican lawmakers jumped at the opportunity and repeated the claim of 'death panels' whenever possible. The reform never recovered from this drop. In December 2009, four months after the statement, support and opposition were virtually identical to August. While the public was still uncertain about the exact contents of the law, Palin had asserted that it would include a Big Brother type panel that decided whether people would live or die. This drowned out any efforts by the Obama administration to show the law as a cost-reducing reform. Palin's frame of the ACA, in other words, drastically influenced public opinion of the reform.

Framing is the practice of presenting an issue to affect the way people see it. Numerous experiments have shown that framing can have substantial influence in moving people's opinions.

Both methods developed in chapters II and III are applied in the survey experiment and their performance is analyzed.




## Theory {#framing-theory}

### Framing {#framing-theory-framing}

People usually don't have stable, consistent, and informed opinions [@converse_nature_1964; @zaller_nature_1992]. It is therefore possible to influence people's opinion through communication. One of the ways to do so is framing. Framing is the practice of presenting an issue to affect the way people see it [@aaroe_investigating_2011;@druckman_evaluating_2001;@gross_framing_2008]. We learn about healthcare reform through articles, reports, speeches, commercials and social media. This mediated communication possesses tremendous potential influence on our perception of political issues [@iyengar_framing_1996;@kam_risk_2010;@tversky_framing_1981]. Framing research has established that a variety of frames substantively influence how people view and think about issues, such as the ACA [@price_switching_1997;@andsager_how_2000;@callaghan_introduction_2005;@entman_framing_1993;@entman_projections_2004;@gamson_media_1989;@lahav_ideological_2012;@pan_framing_1993;@slothuus_political_2010;@sniderman_structure_2004;@vreese_effects_2004]. When frames influence people's opinion about an issue, we speak of a framing effect. Two different types of framing effects have evolved in the literature: Equivalency and emphasis framing effects.

Equivalency framing effects involve phrasing the same logical content in different ways, i.e. "casting the same information in either a positive or negative light" [@druckman_2004_political, p. 671]. One example is @tversky_framing_1981's death and survival experiment: Presented with a hypothetical disease outbreak in the US that is expected to kill 600 people, respondents were asked to choose between alternating programs. The first group chose between programs A and B. In program A, "200 people will be saved". In program B, "there is 1/3 probability that 600 people will be saved and 2/3 probabilitty that no people will be saved". The second group chose between programs C and D. In program C, "400 people will die". In program D, "there is 1/3 probability that nobody will die, and 2/3 probability that 600 people will die". The factual content given to both groups is of course identical: In both groups, the first program results in the death of 400 people, and the second program has a 66 percent chance of killing all 600 people. The differences is the light cast on this information. The frames given to group 1 focus on lives saved, whereas the frames presented to group 2 center on lives lost. Rationally, both are the same. However, this difference in equalency framing matters: The majority in group 1 chose program A. The majority in group 2 chose program D. Other work focuses on policy evaluations, rather than risk preferences. For example, respondents were found to rate a proposed economic program more favorably when it is framed as resulting in 95 percent employment, instead of it's logical equivalent, 5 percent unemployment [@quattrone_1988_contrasting]. Equivalency framing effects have been likened by some to survey question wording effects [@zaller_nature_1992]. Examples here are the alternate use of "not allow" and "forbid" in reference to Communist speech in the 1970s, which can arguably be described as substantively and logically equivalent [@bartels_2003_democracy, p. 61].

Emphasis framing effects concern putting the stress on a particular aspect, viewpoint, or consideration about an issue in the attempt to get people to look at the issue in the proposed way. Describing the invasion of Iraq as freeing the population and gifting them democracy, as done by the Bush administration, for instance, emphasizes a very different viewpoint than a possible alternative narrative that focuses on the economic benefits of gaining access to oil fields and trade opportunities. Unlike equivalency frames, emphasis frames are not logically identical ways of phrasing the same issue. Instead, they highlight qualitatitely different considerations of that issue [@druckman_implications_2001; @druckman_limits_2001; @kinder_1996_divided; @levin_1998_frames; @nelson_1996_issue; @sniderman_structure_2004], forcing people to think about the relative importance of the differing considerations suggested by the frame [@nelson_media_1997].

More recently, a third (sub-)strain in framing literature has emerged that aims at the separation of framing and persuasion in experimental framing research. It rejects 'classic' definitions of emphasis frames as "reducing a usually complex issue to one or two central aspects" [@nelson_media_1997, p. 568] or identifying "the essence of the issue" [@gamson_1987_changing, p. 143] in favor of "a message that provides an interpretation of an issue or policy by emphasizing which aspect of the issue is relevant for evaluating it, without the frame itself providing any new substantive information about the issue" [@leeper_2020_news, p.4; also see @price_switching_1997]. Whereas persuasion entails the provision of new information to change people's opinions, framing reorganizes existing information already present in people's minds and attempts to direct people's attention towards these particular considerations [@druckman_2003_framing]. Emphasis framing should thus be seen as emphasis of existing information only, in contrast to persuasion that aspires to change people's opinions by "the supply of arguments and evidence" [@kinder_20003_communication, p. 367]. Opinion change in framing thus occurs when people put more or less consideration on previously known aspects about an issue, whereas opinion change in persuasion results from the processing of new information.

I will be focusing on emphasis frames. We know that emphasis frames work because they move persuasive information to the top of people's minds [@zaller_nature_1992]. However, despite the mass of experimental framing research, we still have little insight into what makes an emphasis frame strong. We don't know why some emphasis frames elicit effects and others don't, i.e. we don't know why some emphasis frames are successful at moving persuasive information to the top of people's minds and others are not. We just know that strong frames are stronger than weak frames. A major challenge for framing research thus "concerns the identification of factors that make a frame strong" [@chong_framing_2007, p. 116]. 

In the attempt to address this challenge, scholars have increasingly adopted theory-driven approaches that deduce likely strong frames and subsequently empirically evluate their theoretical expectations. [@arceneaux_cognitive_2012, p. 280] for instance theorizes that "individuals are more likely to be persuaded by political arguments that evoke cognitive biases" and asserts that messages which highlight out-group threats resonate with respondents to a greater extent. @druckman_framing_2011 report that adding factual information to messages about carbon nanotubes does nothing to enhance their strength and actually makes the message weaker. @feinberg_2012_moral assess whether frames are stronger when they cohere with an individual's personal value system. They frame environmental issues as a matter of 'purity', a theme that supposedly correlates with conservative ideology, and find this approach leads to increased conservative support of environmental policies. I attempt to provide a further avenue of clarification by testing whether moral arguments are part of what makes frames strong. Contrary to previous theory-driven approaches, I will keep the distinction between emphasis and the provision of new information in mind.



### Morality and Self-Interest {#framing-theory-morality-self_interest}


Scholars find that moral arguments are ubiquitous in political issues because they are essential to how people perceive and make sense of the world around them [@frank_whats_2005;@mooney_public_2001;@tatalovich_moral_1994]. 

It is widely argued that people rely to a disproportionate extent on moral arguments to form their opinions and apply this moralization to political issues [@ryan_no_2014;@ryan_reconsidering_2014;@smith_typologies_2002]. 

Morals play a role in establishing one's self-concept and identity . Moral arguments can achieve a much higher emotional connection with people because they invoke people's values and feelings [@skitka_moral_2005;@skitka_moral_2011;@haidt_moral_2003;@tatalovich_moral_2011]. People feel emotionally committed to their values [@ryan_reconsidering_2014; @suhay_2008_group; @tetlock_1996_revising]. Emotions play an important role in how people conceptualize moral stimuli. Appeals to values/morals tend to be more successful than non-moral appeals "especially when the moral principles invoked resonate with the individuals targeted by the appeal" [@feinberg_2013_moral, p. 57]. Moralization literature conceptually defines moral arguments as (1) near-universal standards of truth, (2) almost objective facts about the world, and (3) independent of institutional authority [@skitka_psychology_2010]. The strength of attitudes meaningfully differs when they are held with moral conviction [@baron_protected_1997;@bennis_costs_2010;@ditto_motivated_2009;@tetlock_correspondence_2003].

ME: I ask people to assess issues on relevant moral grounds and in self-interest terms of the consequences for their lives. Then we can see whether people vary in their view of whether a policy advances their interests and whether people differ in the weight they give to different moral criteria when forming policy opinions. Combine self-assessed moral conviction with unenlightened self-interest.

[@stoker_1992_interest]:
Central claim of economic theory: homo economicus, i.e. the rational man who pursues his selfish interests [@coleman_1986_individual]. There is weak and little evidence for that [@citrin_1990_self-interest; @mansbridge_1980_beyond; @sears_self-interest_1990]. In a follow-up approach, rational choice theorists claim people simply want to maximize their utility, defining self-interest to include material and immaterial, selfish and altruistic interests [@arrow_1967_values; @downs_economic_1957; @olson_logic_1965; @opp_rationality_1989]. A competing direction defines self-interest narrowly in a contrast between selfish and non-selfish preferences, highlighting the significance of non-selfish motives such as love [@mansbridge_1990_relation], sympathy [@sen_rational_1977], and justice [@tyler_1990_people]. The first apprach casts a wide net and says that people seek whatever they find to be in their interest. People pursue their interests but those interests may include non-selfish ones. The second equals self-interest with self-regarding and juxtaposes self-regarding interests with non-egoist ones. Non-egoist interests are here conceptually different from self-regarding ones. Stoker argues that people don't just want to satisfy their preferences (self-regarding or not self-regarding), but neither do they set aside their self-regarding preferences in favor of some non-self-regarding ones. Instead, they deal with the 'central problem of ethics': "how the lives, interests, and welfare of others make claims on us, and how these claims, of various forms, are to be reconciled with the aim of living our own lives" [@nagel_1970_possibility, p. 142]. Stoker paints citizens as ethical actors.

Framing on morals/values so far:
"Although there are a wide variety of ways in which messages can be framed, one powerful example involves a speaker invoking moral values that resonate with the message recipient" [@bayes_2020_when, p. 3]. 
@slothuus_political_2010: how framing political messages in terms of values consistent with partisan motivations shapes acceptance of these messages
@wolsko_2016_white: conservatives who receive a message framed on the moral foundations that their in-group strongly endorses (loyalty, authority, sanctity) are likely to believe more in climate change 
@feinberg_2013_moral: reframing environmental messages in line with partisan moral values decreases polarization gap between liberals and conservatives

A lot of scholarly work tries to establish a distinction between moral and nonmoral issues, yet agreement on the definition of a 'moral issue' remains elusive. To some, an issue is moral when at least one side sees the issue as threatening a core value/princple and/or uses moral arguments to support their position [@mooney_public_2001; @haider-markel_1996_politics]. To others, moral issues are based on values rooted deeply within people's belief systems [@biggers_2011_when; @glick_2001_physician-assisted]. Yet another strain sees morality as intrinsic to some issues, i.e. nontechnical issues that are easy to understand or issues that concern fundamental aspects of life and death [@engeli_2012_theoretical; @studlar_2001_what; @tavits_2007_principle]. Despite these divergences, scholars appear to agree that economic issues are not to be considered moral [@abramowitz_1995_abortion; @engeli_2012_theoretical; @frank_whats_2005; @mooney_1995_legislative; @tatalovich_moral_2011]. This distinction in unison, particularly given the divergence on the definition of a 'moral issue', is puzzling.

The idea of deciding up-front whether an issue is moral, i.e. examining how people respond in situations that meet pre-set definitions of morality, follows the tradition of moral judgment. In the realm of moral judgment, researchers decide, objectively along a set of criteria, whether an issue is moral. This stands in contrast to moral conviction.

In moral conviction theory, morality lies in the eye of the beholder, i.e. people decide whether they consider an issue to be moral. Moral conviction "classifies stimuli as moral or nonmoral as a function of individuals' perceptions of situations rather than according to characteristics of the situation" [@bauman_2009_mind, p. 342]. Rather than presupposing the morality of an issue externally, it is argued that people recognize a moral sentiment when they experience one, as it touches their perceived connection of what is right and wrong [@bandura_1986_social; @cervone_2004_architecture; @goodwin_2008_psychology; @skitka_2008_morality]. This recognition and perception, however, varies considerably depending on the person experiencing the potentially moral situation. Defining an issue or situation as moral then becomes a subjective endeavour for each individual person and their psychological reality [@haidt_2001_emotional; @haidt_2003_emotional; @morgan_2010_moral; @skitka_2008_moral]. What I consider to be moral might not be moral to you, and vice versa. The literature shows that moral conviction represents an important force that guides citizen behavior and development of public opinion [@converse_nature_1964;@skitka_moral_2005;@skitka_moral_2011;@smith_typologies_2002;@tatalovich_moral_2011;@zaller_nature_1992]. This has consequences for survey design. Rather than deciding pre-survey which issues are moral (moral judgment), researchers "directly assess the extent that a given issue engages moral conviction and then use those responses to classify whether situations are or are not moral for a specific individual" [@bauman_2009_mind, p. 343]. Following this approach, @ryan_reconsidering_2014 finds evidence that some people perceive distinctly economic issues such as labor relations laws or social security reform in moral ways. Studies on abortion also show that, despite the media's contrary depiction, not everyone conceives of it as a moral issue [@mullen_2006_exploring; @skitka_2002_means; @skitka_moral_2005].


These conceptual definitions are all encompassed in Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), developed by @haidt_2012_righteous and presented in Table \ref{framing-foundations} below.

I combine Linda Skitka's survey-based measurement paradigm for studying moralization with Jonathan Haidt's moral foundations 

Liberals tend towards care/harm and fairness/cheating, while conservatives lean towards loyalty/betrayal, respect/subversion, and sanctity/degradation [@graham_2009_liberals].


These aspects of moralization theory have not been applied to frame strength in experimental research. An abundance of framing research has shown that frames elicit significant changes in issue positioning [@chong_counterframing_2013;@chong_dynamic_2010;@druckman_how_2013;@druckman_limits_2001;@druckman_source_2012;@nelson_media_1997;@slothuus_more_2008]. @brewer_values_2005, for instance, find significant effects for the frames 'School vouchers create an unfair advantage' and 'School vouchers provide help for those who need it'. @druckman_source_2012 provide similar evidence for 'The Affordable Care Act gives more people equal access to health insurance' and 'The ACA increases government costs', while @druckman_how_2013 do so for 'Oil drilling provides economic benefits' and 'Oil drilling endangers marine life'. While we know these frames elicit changes, we do not know why they do so. We do not know why these frames 'work'. I propose a way to understand why some of these frames work, which is based on moralization theory: The presence of moral arguments. 

Applying Moral Foundation Theory, both frames in @brewer_values_2005 could be categorized as containing moral arguments, even though the authors do not explicitly do so. 'School vouchers create an unfair advantage' can be argued to contain the negative moral foundation of \textit{Cheating}, while 'School vouchers provide help for those who need it' contains the positive moral foundations of \textit{Care} and \textit{Fairness}. 'The ACA gives more people equal access to health insurance' [@druckman_source_2012] also could be said to contain the positive moral foundations of \textit{Care} and \textit{Fairness}, while 'Oil drilling endangers marine life' [@druckman_how_2013] contains the negative moral foundation of \textit{Harm}. 

It is important to note that 'The ACA increases government costs' [@druckman_source_2012] and 'Oil drilling provides economic benefits' [@druckman_how_2013] do not directly appeal to morality, yet research has shown them to be strong. Of course, some people might see increasing costs immediately as bad and thus morally detrimental for the future of the country, but these frames do not make such an appeal directly, on the surface. This distinguishes them from moral frames.

This might lead one to assert that moral arguments do not form a part of frame strength -- after all, if a frame does not contain a direct moral argument but is proven to be strong nonetheless, surely then frame strength does not depend on the presence of moral arguments. This hypothetical argument is flawed, however. For one, the search for the source of frame strength is not the search for a universal 'holy grail' argument whose presence is a precondition for frame strength. There probably are many aspects that can make a frame strong, with moral arguments potentially being one of them, not the only one. Second, the studies with these two amoral and two moral arguments do not distinguish between the directions in which the moral and amoral frames act. 

In the case of @druckman_source_2012, 'The Affordable Care Act gives more people equal access to health insurance' contains a positive, i.e. support-inducing, moral argument, while 'The ACA increases government costs' contains a negative, i.e. opposition-inducing, amoral argument. They act in opposite directions. A comparison of these frames alone does not yield sufficient results as we would not be able to identify the exact cause of the framing effect. Is 'The Affordable Care Act gives more people equal access to health insurance' strong because it supports the issue or because it contains a moral argument? Similarly, is 'The ACA increases government costs' strong because it opposes the issue or because it contains a amoral argument? This set-up cannot answer these questions. 

To establish whether moral arguments are part of what makes a frame strong, we need a design that assesses the strength of frames with moral and amoral arguments whilst accounting for both signs, opposing and supporting, in both sets of frames. I provide such a design.

Overall, experimental framing research has shown that many frames have significant framing effects. It is still unclear, however, what makes these, or indeed any, frame strong [@druckman_political_2018]. Moralization theory claims that moral arguments possess enormous power shape human behavior and influence public opinion [@haidt_moral_2003]. I combine these two sets of literature and analyze whether moral arguments form a part of what makes frames strong. I use a variety of data sources to investigate the following hypothesis:



<!-- begin self-interest -->

Among the main ingredients of public opinion are commitment to principles (i.e. morals) and material interests that citizens see at stake [@kinder_1998_opinion]. The first part is covered above by morals. The second part, self-interest, is addressed here. Self-interest appears not to matter much when it comes to political opinions: The unemployed do not favor policies to increase employment more than those with jobs [@schlozman_1979_injury], people with health concerns do not show stronger support for government health insurance than others [@sears_self-interest_1980], and working women do not differ from homemakers in their attitudes towards benefits for women in the workplace [@sears_1990_origins]. Political opinions thus tend to be disconnected from self-interest. 

Unenlightened self-interest [@bartels_2005_homer]: A majority of Americans supported the 2001 and 2003 Bush administration tax cuts, even though they were designed to disproportionately benefit the rich. Economic self-interest can't explain this, since the majority of Americans suffered economically from the cuts. As Bartels shows, neither can people's attitudes towards the tax burden born by the rich. Instead, attitude towards the tax cuts was shaped by respondents' perceived self-interest: The tax burden they had to endure. In grossly exaggerated terms: They felt their tax burden was too high, so they supported the tax cuts, even though, in material terms, the cuts hurt them. Bartels call this "unenlightened self-interest" (p. 23). Bartels further shows that highly informed respondents had a very different attitude: They overwhelmingly opposed the cuts. He suggests that it may be unreasonable to expect Americans to make informed decisions on highly complex issues such as tax reform, which is why they might revert to subjective perception (unenlightened self-interest) rather than objective calculation (material self-interest).

Supposedly good surveys of empirical literature on self-interest:
Citrin & Green 1990
Sears & Funk 1991
Tyler 1990





### Hypothesis {#framing-theory-hypothesis}


A strong frame is not a morally superior argument. The content of a frame and its strength to change opinions need to be kept separate.


\vspace{0.3cm}
\begin{adjustwidth*}{+1cm}{+1cm}
\textbf{H.} Moral arguments form a part of what makes political frames strong.
\end{adjustwidth*}


Moral attitudes are said to be more important than nonmoral ones since a threat to a person's morals directly threatens that person's sense of identity and self. Nonmoral arguments, on the other hand, are less related to a person's identity and thus deemed less important [@haugtvedt_1994_message; @johnson_1989_effects].


## Data {#framing-data}

### Pre-Tests {#framing-data-pre_test}

Survey questions are best designed if researchers have a firm grasp of the underlying realities that participants have to report [@carpini_1993_measuring;@stanley_2016_using;@conover_1991_nature]. Following this line of argument, pre-testing frames with participants who are not part of the main survey experiment is crucial in frame analysis. These participants are exposed to the designed frames and asked whether they reflect the core ideas behind 'moral' and 'self-interest'. This pre-test structure builds on work by @slothuus_political_2010 and @chong_framing_2007, following the mass communication and persuasion literature [@okeefe_2002_persuasion]. The pre-test is carried out on Amazon's online platform MTurk. MTurk is a service where researchers can host tasks to be completed by anonymous participants. Participants receive financial compensation for their work and Amazon collects a commission. MTurk samples have been shown to be internally valid in survey experiments [@berinsky_evaluating_2012]. The use of MTurk in political science experiments has increased dramatically over the past decade and is now common practice [@hauser_attentive_2016]. This pre-test represents a thorough, robust safety net to ensure that the designed frames connect with participants, which in turn ensures meaningful survey results.





### Survey Experiment {#framing-data-survey}

The survey experiment builds on the insights from the pre-test. It is fielded online for a random sample of U.S. adults with Lucid. Lucid has been shown to be equally reliable and performs well on a national scale in survey experiments [@coppock_2019_validating].
The experiment features frames with 'moral' and 'self-interest' arguments, reflecting the respective descriptions.
The survey also collects demographic information on standard political science variables.
The selected issues are chosen from previous research. The form a combination of big-hitter issues (gay marriage, abortion, climate change) and smaller issues (TBD) where you can move the needle.
Respondents are blocked on ordinal variables with the method from chapter I. As part of the analysis, the ordinal variable imputation method from chapter II is applied to inserted missing data. We can assess the performance of ordinal variable imputation method because we know the true values of the completely observed data.


<!-- moral conviction measure -->

Skitka and colleagues have developed an approach to reliably measure moral conviction in respondents, which has been validated across many studies [@ryan_no_2014; @skitka_moral_2005; @skitka_psychology_2010]: 

"To what extent is your opinion on [issue] ..."
"... a reflection of your core moral beliefs and convictions?"
"... deeply connected to your fundamental beliefs about right and wrong?"
"... based on a moral principle?"

[Not at all; slightly; moderately; much; very much]
