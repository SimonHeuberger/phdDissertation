  Surveys are a central part of political science. Without surveys, we would not know what people think about political issues. Survey experiments also enable us to test how people react to given treatments. Surveys and survey experiments are only as good as the analytical techniques we as researchers use, though. This applies particularly to how we use and measure variables. For ordinal variables, some of our current measurements and techniques are insufficient. Ordinal variables consist of ordered categories where the spacing between each category is uneven and not known. One example is education, one of the most important predictors of political behavior. The distances between education categories such as "Elementary School", "Some High School", and "High School Graduate" are not evenly spread. Current practice nonetheless often does not take this information into account. This could misrepresent the data and potentially distort results. My dissertation develops two methods to address this and applies them in original survey research. Chapter \ref{ordblock} develops a new method to improve the use of ordinal variables in blocking in survey experiments. Preliminary evidence suggests that the re-estimation of ordinal variable categories with an ordered probit approach might matter. Chapter \ref{ordmiss} develops a new method to treat missing survey data with ordinal variables. The results show that the method performs worse than existing software, with exceptions in specific cases. Chapter \ref{framing} applies both methods in an online survey experiment that tests morality and self-interest in political framing. The results confirm the findings from the previous chapters and show tentative evidence for the importance of morality in issue-opposing frames.

  Throughout the writing of this dissertation I have received a great deal of support and assistance. First and foremost, I want to thank my supervisor and chair Jeff Gill. It is safe to say that this dissertation would not exist without him. He has been my guide in the world of political methodology and has set me on a path I would not have taken without him. In addition to his invaluable and unwavering support throughout this project, Jeff also trusted me with the replications for Political Analysis. Working for PA has provided me with contact to scholars around the world, which has opened countless doors to job opportunities. It was a pleasure and a true honor to work with Jeff all these years.\newline
  I am also extremely grateful for all the other members on my committee. Ryan Moore has accompanied me on my graduate journey from the beginning as my teacher, supervisor, and committee member. He introduced me to `R` six years ago, and I have never looked back. He has been a fountain of knowledge in all things statistics and coding throughout. Without Liz Suhay, the framing chapter would be a shadow of what it has become. Her passion for emotions and clear eye for detail has been a huge support in designing the experiment and developing the questionnaire. I met Mike Alvarez through my work for PA several years ago. He has been an inspiration on replication work, and I am honored that he accepted my invitation to join the committee. Finally, Betty Malloy very kindly agreed to serve as the external reader at very short notice during tumultuous Covid times. I am extremely grateful for all their contributions and support. I consider myself very lucky to have been given the chance to work with such outstanding scholars.\newline
  On a personal level, thanks are endless. To my friend Gabe: You have been a hero during the dissertation stage. I could not and would not have done this without you. When things got tough, you were there. Your `R` proficiency leaves a little to be desired but hey, no one is perfect. I missed you terribly during these Covid times and hope to see you again soon. To my friend Hauke: We have known each other for many years, and I am blessed by each one. I will never forget the emotional and practical support you have given me all this time. I am honored to be Linus' godfather. To many, many more years of friendship to come. Lastly, to my family Angelika, Ludwig, Katherina, Kilian, Lorenz, and Michela: You guys are my everything. No more and no less. I don't know what I would do without any of you. Life is good because of you.\newline
  Last but never ever least: Eternal gratitude for love and devotion that outshines humankind to Fendi and Muesli, the two greatest creatures on the planet and the best things I have ever done. And of course to Waldemar Burgo.
