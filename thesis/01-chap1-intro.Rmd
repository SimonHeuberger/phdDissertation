# OUTLINE {#intro}

<!--
Some general text about surveys and survey experiments. Basically the abstract, but longer, more elaborate.
-->

General stuff that connects everything: Survey experiments, ordinal variables. 

What's really important for survey experiments? Balance (hence blocking), missing data (hence hd.ord)

Chapter 1 introduces issues surrounding ordinal variables and outlines the ordered probit approach. It then uses the approach to block external survey data. I conduct variance tests and a placebo regression.
Chapter 2 uses the approach to impute artificially inserted missing data in external survey data. I compare the performance to common imputation techniques.
Chapter 3 applies OP blocking and OP multiple imputation to an original survey experiment on political framing.





## Blocking {#intro-blocking}

How the ordered probit approach for ordinal variables is used to 'prepare' the data before blocking.



## Missing Data {#intro-missing}

How the ordered probit approach is used to impute missing data with ordinal variables.



## Application {#intro-application}

How the ordered probit blocking and ordered probit missing data methods are applied in a framing survey experiment.

 Since there currently is no available tool to block online survey experiments, I create my own survey environment in `R shiny`, which is outlined in appendix section \ref{app-ordblock-env}.
