%		\item Page 108: you say "Most importantly, however, we have learned that the current practice of converting ordinal explanatory variables into numerical variables does not seem to be problematic after all, as this convenience method appears to closely reflect the true underlying data structure." I have a competing view. I think that there is a lot of psychological heterogeneity around how people interpret survey questions, especially about moral issues. So the aggregated measures have a lot of variance. Think about 7 normal distributions on the same x-axis with a lot of overlap. So modelers "get" away with turning uneven ordinalizations into consecutive digits. I'm not sure how this would be tested though
