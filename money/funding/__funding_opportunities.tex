%		\item \st{Funding period: May 1, 2018 -- April 30, 2019 (money must be spent in that period)}
%		\item \st{You need to keep receipts for reimbursement -- they don't simply give you money to spend}
%		\item \st{All reimbursement receipts need to be handed in (as scans) to the Office of Graduate Studies by April 27, 2019}
%		\item \st{You can submit receipts multiple times, whenever you want, you don't have to wait until the end of the funding period}
%		\item \st{You usually get reimbursed within 10 business days}
%		\item \st{They usually hand out 21-23 scholarships -- last year, only 25 people applied (so the odds look quite good)}
%		\item \st{Contact for everything is Jonathan Tubman -- he is the Vice Provost for Research and Dean of Graduate Studies (jtubman@american.edu)}
%		\item \st{It is possible to get the award more than once -- if there are not enough qualified applications in that year, if you need an extra \$1,200 to what you already got, that kind of thing}
