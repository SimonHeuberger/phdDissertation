\noindent To the Selection Committee, \\

This letter is attached to address my eligibility for the Neil and Ann Kerwin Doctoral Fellowship. I believe I qualify for the award because:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item I have a GPA of 3.83, having completed all courses with at least a B+. I have completed all my comprehensive exams on the first attempt. I passed the American Politics exam in August 2017 and the Comparative Politics exam in December 2017. I also passed the additional Methodology comprehensive exam in August 2018 after my decision to focus my dissertation on quantitative methodology.
	\item My dissertation proposal was approved in August 2018, under the supervision of my committee chair, Prof. Jeff Gill. (The direction of the dissertation has evolved since the approval. As a result, the title on the signed title page is outdated and differs from the one in this fellowship application.)
	\item I am dedicated to a career in university teaching. I have demonstrated this with continuous teaching engagement during my time at American University. I worked as the TA for GOVT-310 Introduction to Political Research for Prof. Jan Leighley in the summer of 2016 and for Prof. Ryan T. Moore in the spring of 2017. I also TAd for Prof. Jeff Gill for SPA-696 Bayesian Statistics for Social and Biomedical Sciences in the fall of 2018 and again for Prof. Moore for GOVT-496/696 Winter Institute in Data Science and Big Data in 2020. As an adjunct instructor, I taught GOVT-310 in the fall of 2018 and GOVT-110 Politics in the U.S. as well as GOVT-102 Political Action and Public Policy in the summer of 2019.
	\item My primary focus is to successfully defend my dissertation by the end of the academic year 2020/21. I have developed all methodological contributions and have set up the online environment needed to apply them in an original survey experiment. I have also contracted more than 2,000 respondents and have completed first drafts with complete literature reviews of all chapters. I am very confident that the remaining work (method simulations, survey questionnaire design and testing, fielding the experiment, analysis of the results) will be completed within the time frame of the fellowship.
	\item With two methods and one application part, my dissertation is set up in paper format. I plan to submit each part separately to a major refereed journal (\textit{Political Analysis}, \textit{Journal of Statistical Software} \textit{Political Behavior}, \textit{Public Opinion Quarterly}) upon completion of the survey experiment and the analysis of its results.
\end{enumerate}
