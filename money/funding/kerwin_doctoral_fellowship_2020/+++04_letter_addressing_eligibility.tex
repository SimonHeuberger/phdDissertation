\noindent To the Selection Committee, \\

This letter is attached to address my eligibility for the Neil and Ann Kerwin Doctoral Fellowship. I believe I qualify for the award because:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item I have completed all my comprehensive exams. I passed the American Politics exam in August 2017 and the Comparative Politics exam in December 2017. I also passed the additional Methodology comprehensive exam in August 2018 after my decision to focus my dissertation on quantitative methodology.
	\item My dissertation proposal was approved in August 2018, under the supervision of my committee chair, Prof. Jeff Gill. (The direction of the dissertation has evolved since the approval. As a result, the title on the signed title page is outdated and differs from the one in this fellowship proposal.)
	\item I am dedicated to a career in university teaching. I have demonstrated this with continuous teaching engagement during my time at American University. I worked as the TA for GOVT-310 Introduction to Political Research for Prof. Jan Leighley in the summer of 2016 and for Prof. Ryan T. Moore in the spring of 2017. I also TAd for Prof. Jeff Gill in SPA-696 Bayesian Statistics for Social and Biomedical Sciences. As an adjunct instructor, I taught GOVT-310 in the fall of 2018 and am currently teaching the online course GOVT-110 Politics in the U.S.. Over the course of the next academic year, I am also scheduled to teach GOVT-102 Political Action and Public Policy (online, July/August), GOVT-492 Seminar for Teaching Assistants (fall 2019), and GOVT-310 again (spring 2020).
	\item I intend to devote my time to working on my dissertation over the coming year. My primary focus is to complete my dissertation and expand my teaching portfolio in order to enter the academic job market in the fall of 2020.
	\item My dissertation is on track to be defended within the time frame of the fellowship. I have identified the methodological contributions my research will make and have fully developed the online survey environment needed to apply them in an original survey experiment. I have also recruited more than 2,000 respondents to participate in the experiment. There are no obstacles that prevent me from completing the remaining work, such as designing the survey questionnaire.
\end{enumerate}
