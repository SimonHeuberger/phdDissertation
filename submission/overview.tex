\date{\today}

\begin{document}

\maketitle



\section*{Timeline}
	\begin{coi}
		\item Apply for graduation early in the semester you wish to defend your thesis/dissertation (see deadlines below)
		\item Submit a draft version for formatting review \href{http://www.etdadmin.com/american}{here} (see deadlines below) -- the diss does not have to be finished at this point; it's just for formatting
			\begin{coi}
				\item I have created an account
				\item Bob Briggs deals with all things formatting for SPA. He will be the one to review the formatting once submitted, so the formatting only has to pass him. For instance, he agreed that having lot and lof before the toc is fine 
			\end{coi}
		\item Defend dissertation
			\begin{coi}
				\item I need to tell the Office of Graduate Studies two weeks before my defense that it's happening
				\item I also need the external reader approved by the Office of Graduate Studies
			\end{coi}
		\item Make all the editorial changes your advisor and committee suggest
		\item Collect your chair and committee members' signatures on a printed copy of your title page
		\item Submit title page to be signed by the Dean of your school or college
		\item Check with your department/advisor to make sure all grades from previous semesters (e.g., thesis/dissertation research hours that have grades of IP) and the current semester have been submitted
		\item Submit final version of dissertation (see deadlines below) twice
			\begin{coi}
				\item Electronic copy in AU Digital Research Archive (AUDRA)
					\begin{coi}
						\item Option 1: Open access for all
						\item Option 2: AU access only
					\end{coi}
				\item ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database
					\begin{coi}
						\item Option 1: Traditional Publishing. No charge for me, they can sell copies and I get a small portion of proceeds
						\item Option 2: Open Access. I have to pay them to make my paper open access, \$95. Bollocks, not doing that, open access through AUDRA anyway
