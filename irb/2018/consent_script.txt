You are being asked to participate in a research study conducted by Jeff Gill and Simon Heuberger. We are researchers in political science at American University. The purpose of this study is to collect opinions on several issues. No prior knowledge is required; all issues will be explained briefly before we ask for your opinion. This study will contribute to the the completion of Simon Heuberger's PhD thesis.

This study consists of 21 questions that you answer in your browser. You will be asked to give your opinion on several political issues as well as provide some demographic background information (for example your age, income, and education).

Completing the survey will take around 15 minutes. Your compensation for the completion of the survey is $1.00.
You will need to complete the survey in one sitting. The system will automatically log you out after 1 hour of inactivity.

Completing the survey is anonymous. MTurk does not share any identifiable information with us.

Aggregate, non-identifiable data will be presented representing averages or generalizations about the responses as a whole. All the data will be stored in a secure location accessible only to us, the researchers.

Your participation is entirely voluntary. You are free to choose not to participate. You can also withdraw from the survey by closing your browser at any time. Incomplete answers will not be recorded.
