# phdDissertation

This repository contains the code to compile my PhD dissertation in Political Science at American University, written with [eagledown](https://github.com/SimonHeuberger/eagledown) in `R Markdown`. The dissertation is titled "What people think: Advances in public opinion measurement using ordinal variables" and develops and applies new methods to measure ordinal variables. 

Chapter 2 develops a new method to improve the use of ordinal variables in blocking in survey experiments. Preliminary evidence suggests that the re-estimation of ordinal variable categories with an ordered probit approach might matter. Chapter 3 develops a new method to treat missing survey data with ordinal variables. The results show that the method performs worse than existing software, with exceptions in specific cases. Chapter 4 applies both methods in an online survey experiment that tests morality and self-interest in political framing. The results confirm the findings from the previous chapters and show tentative evidence for the importance of morality in issue-opposing frames.
