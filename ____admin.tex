\section*{Final steps}
	\begin{coi}
		\item Work in all the revisions (bullet point list and red font in diss)
		\item Have all committee members sign title page while I'm doing the revisions
			\begin{coi}
				\item Betty has signed
				\item Next up is Mike
			\end{coi}
		\item Send Jeff the bullet point list, the diss (with red font parts), and the signed title page with all other signatures for him to sign
		\item Forward page with all committee signatures to Bob
		\item Bob contacts Vicky for her signature
		\item Bob sends copy with all signatures (including Vicky's) to Registrar to confirm completion
		\item Bob also sends copy to me
		\item Include copy once with all signatures in my final submission (i.e. not twice as in the template, just once)
		\item (Grade is missing for spring 21, which Jeff will submit this semester)
		\item (Grade is missing for Fall 2018, Govt 096. 002, which was an audit with Ryan. There needs to be a grade here (which for an audit is ``L"). Bob contacted Ryan about this)


	\end{coi}

 
\section*{Before final submission for aesthetics}
	\begin{coi}
		\item When I have worked in all revisions and when Jeff has signed off on them, remove red font in .Rmd 
		\item Then fix any gaps manually in the .tex:
			\begin{coi}
				\item Copy the thesis folder to the Desktop
				\item In authesis.cls
					\begin{coi}
						\item Change \texttt{sources/authesis} to \texttt{../sources/authesis}
						\item Change \texttt{sources/au} to \texttt{../sources/au}
					\end{coi}
				\item In dissertation.tex:
					\begin{coi}
						\item Change \texttt{sources/authesis} to \texttt{../sources/authesis}
						\item Change \texttt{dissertation\_files/} to \texttt{../\_bookdown\_files/dissertation\_files/}
						\item Change \texttt{figures/} to \texttt{../figures/}
						\item Change \texttt{data/} to \texttt{../data/}
						\item Wherever there is a big gap, add \texttt{\textbackslash\textbackslash} to the end of the line before the gap, remove any empty following lines, add \texttt{\textbackslash indent} to the beginning of the line after the gap
					\end{coi}
			\end{coi}
	\end{coi}
