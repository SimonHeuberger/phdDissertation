		\item Ryan: ``I recommend another pass through the thesis, with an eye toward smooth writing and style. I appreciate short, declarative sentences, but this tone is quite clipped"
		\item Go through pdf and search for .0, .1, .2 (i.e. missing leading zeros)
		\item Fill in acknowledgements
		\item Go through Jeff's email (in /defense) and make sure I understand the mechanism behind the OP model (and why it's sound)
