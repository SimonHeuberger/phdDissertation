\section*{Experiment}
	\begin{coi}
		\item I paid \$4,662 for 2,331 respondents with Lucid and \$168 with MTurk. I can spend MTurk whenever I want. Lucid will wait for my go-ahead to launch the actual project
	\end{coi}	
	
	
	
\section*{Structure outline}
	\begin{coi}
		\item Structure everything around surveys/measurement/ordinal variables, just like in my Kerwin proposal
		\item Paper I is the ordered probit threshold approach for blocking on ordinal variables
			\begin{coi}
				\item Simulations
			\end{coi}
		\item Paper II uses the paper I thresholds to adapt multiple hot deck imputation of missing data for ordinal variables
			\begin{coi}
				\item Simulations
			\end{coi}
		\item Paper III applies paper I and II methods in an online survey experiment on the potential importance of moral arguments for frame strength
			\begin{coi}
				\item MTurk for pre-testing
				\item Survey experiment
			\end{coi}
	\end{coi}

\section*{Committee}
	\begin{coi}
		\item I want a committee member who knows a methods diss, is supportive, and not problematic. I don't need more guidance; I have Jeff and Ryan for that. Candidates:
			\begin{coi}
				\item Mike Alvarez
					\begin{coi}
						\item Ask him to be external reader at PolMeth
					\end{coi}
				\item Liz Suhay
					\begin{coi}
						\item She has input on framing but is fine with the methods parts, since Jeff and Ryan have signed off on them
						\item She would be happy to be a committee member
					\end{coi}
				\item Joe Young
				\item Jan Leighley
			\end{coi}
	\end{coi}



\section*{Ordinal blocking}
	\begin{coi}
		\item \texttt{ordered\_outcomes\_modeling}
			\begin{coi}
				\item Do Monte Carlo simulations
					\begin{coi}
						\item \hl{Read through the resources Jeff sent me}
					\end{coi}
				\item \hl{Emphasize machine learning in the write-up}
			\end{coi}
	\end{coi}
	
\section*{Ordinal missing}
	\begin{coi}
		\item Ordinal Hot Decking
			\begin{coi}
				\item \texttt{testing.R}
					\begin{coi}
						\item \hl{Continue with TO DOs}			
					\end{coi}
			\end{coi}
		\item Theory
			\begin{coi}
				\item \hl{Step by step fill in the sections on Missing Data, Deletion, and Imputation}
			\end{coi}
	\end{coi}
