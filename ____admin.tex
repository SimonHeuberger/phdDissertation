\section*{Experiment}
	\begin{coi}
		\item I paid \$4,662 for 2,331 respondents with Lucid and \$168 with MTurk. I can spend MTurk whenever I want. Lucid will wait for my go-ahead to launch the actual project
	\end{coi}	
	
\section*{Structure outline}
	\begin{coi}
		\item Structure everything around surveys/measurement/ordinal variables, just like in my Kerwin proposal
		\item Paper I is the ordered probit threshold approach for blocking on ordinal variables
			\begin{coi}
				\item Simulations
			\end{coi}
		\item Paper II uses the paper I thresholds to adapt multiple hot deck imputation of missing data for ordinal variables
			\begin{coi}
				\item Simulations
			\end{coi}
		\item Paper III applies paper I and II methods in an online survey experiment on the potential importance of moral arguments for frame strength
			\begin{coi}
				\item MTurk for pre-testing
				\item Survey experiment
			\end{coi}
	\end{coi}


\section*{Ordinal missing}
	\begin{coi}
		\item Chapter write-up
			\begin{coi}
				\item \hl{Waiting for feedback from Ryan and Liz}
			\end{coi}
	\end{coi}
	
\section*{Framing}
	\begin{coi}
		\item Rework theory
			\begin{coi}
				\item \hl{Expand framing section}
				\item \hl{Set up section on morality from the literature}
				\item \hl{Set up section self-interest from the literature}
			\end{coi}
	\end{coi} 

\section*{Ordinal blocking}
	\begin{coi}
		\item \texttt{ordered\_outcomes\_modeling}
			\begin{coi}
				\item \hl{Pick this up again when the framing write-up is done and ordinal missing has been signed off on}
			\end{coi}
	\end{coi}
