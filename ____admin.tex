\section*{Overall}
	\begin{coi}
		\item Ryan: ``I recommend another pass through the thesis, with an eye toward smooth writing and style. I appreciate short, declarative sentences, but this tone is quite clipped"
		\item Go through pdf and search for .0, .1, .2 (i.e. missing leading zeros)
		\item Fill in acknowledgements
		\item Try to manually (directly in the .tex file) fix any big page gaps
		\item Go through Jeff's email (in /defense) and make sure I understand the mechanism behind the OP model (and why it's sound)
		\item Perhaps increase size of hlines below long table captions
	\end{coi}	


\section*{Defense}
	\begin{coi}
		\item 15-20 high-level slides
		\item Structure: Here is the big question, here is what I did, here is what I found
		\item Structure for each chapter: Here is something interesting, here is something we don't already know, here is how I approached it, here is what I found, here is what I learned
		\item Words in the main slides, everything else afterwards
		\item Subsets of tables, not whole tables (these are the key variables that I have selected because ...)
		\item Nothing on the background of maths (notation on experiments, multiple imputation etc.)
		\item Ordered probit on a slide in reserve
		\item Non-technical stuff on the top level, be ready for the technical stuff for the questions
		\item Potential question areas:
			\begin{coi}
				\item ``Why is this important?"
				\item ``Why is this new approach to blocking important?"
				\item ``Why is attention to ordinal variables in surveys/survey experiments important?"
				\item Be prepared for these kinds of `higher' questions
				\item Big picture survey ideas (Mike)
				\item Statistical inference processes (Betty)
				\item Framing (Liz)
				\item How would this work in the context of this and that research design, in a different (abstract) context (Ryan)
			\end{coi}
