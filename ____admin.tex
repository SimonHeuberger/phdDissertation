\section*{Defense}
	\begin{coi}
		\item 15-20 high-level slides
		\item Structure: Here is the big question/something interesting, here is why it's interesting, here is how I approached it, here is why I approached it this way, here is what I found, here is what this means
		\item Non-technical stuff on the top level, be ready for the technical stuff for the questions
		\item Potential question areas:
			\begin{coi}
				\item ``Why is this important?"
				\item ``Why is this new approach to blocking important?"
				\item ``Why is attention to ordinal variables in surveys/survey experiments important?"
				\item Be prepared for these kinds of `higher' questions
				\item Big picture survey ideas (Mike)
				\item Statistical inference processes (Betty)
				\item Framing (Liz)
				\item How would this work in the context of this and that research design, in a different (abstract) context (Ryan)
			\end{coi}
	\end{coi}

\section*{Post-defense submission}
	\begin{coi}
		\item When I have worked in all revisions and when Jeff has signed off on them (i.e. when all the content is final), fix any gaps manually in the .tex:
			\begin{coi}
				\item Copy the thesis folder to the Desktop
				\item In authesis.cls
					\begin{coi}
						\item Change \texttt{sources/authesis} to \texttt{../sources/authesis}
						\item Change \texttt{sources/au} to \texttt{../sources/au}
					\end{coi}
				\item In dissertation.tex:
					\begin{coi}
						\item Change \texttt{sources/authesis} to \texttt{../sources/authesis}
						\item Change \texttt{dissertation\_files/} to \texttt{../\_bookdown\_files/dissertation\_files/}
						\item Change \texttt{figures/} to \texttt{../figures/}
						\item Change \texttt{data/} to \texttt{../data/}
						\item Wherever there is a big gap, add \texttt{\textbackslash\textbackslash} to the end of the line before the gap, remove any empty following lines, add \texttt{\textbackslash indent} to the beginning of the line after the gap
					\end{coi}
			\end{coi}
