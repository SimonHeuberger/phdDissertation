\section*{Experiment}
	\begin{coi}
		\item I paid \$4,662 for 2,331 respondents with Lucid and \$168 with MTurk. I can spend MTurk whenever I want. Lucid will wait for my go-ahead to launch the actual project
	\end{coi}	
	
	
	
\section*{Structure outline}
	\begin{coi}
		\item Structure everything around surveys/measurement/ordinal variables, just like in my Kerwin proposal
		\item Paper I is the ordered probit threshold approach for blocking on ordinal variables
			\begin{coi}
				\item Simulations
			\end{coi}
		\item Paper II uses the paper I thresholds to adapt multiple hot deck imputation of missing data for ordinal variables
			\begin{coi}
				\item Simulations
			\end{coi}
		\item Paper III applies paper I and II methods in an online survey experiment on the potential importance of moral arguments for frame strength
			\begin{coi}
				\item MTurk for pre-testing
				\item Survey experiment
			\end{coi}
	\end{coi}

\section*{Committee}
	\begin{coi}
		\item Liz has input on framing and is fine with the methods part
		\item Not much yet from Mike
	\end{coi}



\section*{Ordinal blocking}
	\begin{coi}
		\item \texttt{ordered\_outcomes\_modeling}
			\begin{coi}
				\item Do Monte Carlo simulations
					\begin{coi}
						\item \hl{Read through the resources Jeff sent me}
					\end{coi}
			\end{coi}
	\end{coi}
	
\section*{Ordinal missing}
	\begin{coi}
		\item Code
			\begin{coi}
				\item Add more variables/NAs
					\begin{coi}
						\item \hl{Add every demographic to the data that I still have}				
						\item \hl{Add NAs to 5 of the variables}
					\end{coi}
				\item More methods
					\begin{coi}
						\item \hl{Include mice imputation}
					\end{coi}
				\item What to run \texttt{hot.deck.norm} on
					\begin{coi}
						\item \hl{Run it on the original education values as well}
					\end{coi}
				\item Percentages of NAs
					\begin{coi}
						\item \hl{Expand to 20 and 50 percent NAs when suitable}
					\end{coi}
				\item \texttt{sdCutoff} in \texttt{hot.deck.norm}
					\begin{coi}
						\item \hl{Try shorter test runs with different cutoffs, to possibly rule out ridiculous choices}		
					\end{coi}
			\end{coi}
	\end{coi}
