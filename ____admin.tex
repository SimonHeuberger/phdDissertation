\section*{Final steps}
	\begin{coi}
		\item Forward Jeff's signed title page to Bob
		\item Fix gaps in \texttt{.tex} (see below)
		\item Bob contacts Vicky for her signature, sends copy to Registrar to confirm completion, sends copy to me
		\item Include copy once with all signatures in my final submission (i.e. not twice as in the template, just once)
		\item (Grade is missing for spring 21, which Jeff will submit this semester)
		\item (Grade is missing for Fall 2018, Govt 096. 002, which was an audit with Ryan. There needs to be a grade here (which for an audit is ``L"). Bob contacted Ryan about this)

\section*{Before final submission for aesthetics}
	\begin{coi}
		\item When Jeff has signed off on the revisions, remove red font in \texttt{.Rmd} 
		\item Then fix any gaps manually in the \texttt{.tex}:
			\begin{coi}
				\item Copy the thesis folder to the Desktop
				\item In authesis.cls
					\begin{coi}
						\item Change \texttt{sources/authesis} to \texttt{../sources/authesis}
						\item Change \texttt{sources/au} to \texttt{../sources/au}
					\end{coi}
				\item In dissertation.tex:
					\begin{coi}
						\item Change \texttt{sources/authesis} to \texttt{../sources/authesis}
						\item Change \texttt{dissertation\_files/} to \texttt{../\_bookdown\_files/dissertation\_files/}
						\item Change \texttt{figures/} to \texttt{../figures/}
						\item Change \texttt{data/} to \texttt{../data/}
						\item Wherever there is a big gap, add \texttt{\textbackslash\textbackslash} to the end of the line before the gap, remove any empty following lines, add \texttt{\textbackslash indent} to the beginning of the line after the gap
					\end{coi}
			\end{coi}
	\end{coi}
