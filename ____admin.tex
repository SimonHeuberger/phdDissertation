\section*{Experiment}
	\begin{coi}
		\item I paid \$4,662 for 2,331 respondents with Lucid and \$168 with MTurk. I can spend MTurk whenever I want. Lucid will wait for my go-ahead to launch the actual project
	\end{coi}	
	
	
	
\section*{Structure outline}
	\begin{coi}
		\item Structure everything around surveys/measurement/ordinal variables, just like in my Kerwin proposal
		\item Paper I is the ordered probit threshold approach for blocking on ordinal variables
			\begin{coi}
				\item Simulations
			\end{coi}
		\item Paper II uses the paper I thresholds to adapt multiple hot deck imputation of missing data for ordinal variables
			\begin{coi}
				\item Simulations
			\end{coi}
		\item Paper III applies paper I and II methods in an online survey experiment on the potential importance of moral arguments for frame strength
			\begin{coi}
				\item MTurk for pre-testing
				\item Survey experiment
			\end{coi}
	\end{coi}

\section*{Committee}
	\begin{coi}
		\item Liz has input on framing and is fine with the methods part
		\item Not much yet from Mike
	\end{coi}



\section*{Ordinal blocking}
